# Thesis
The following repository contains code which was used to generate example for my thesis, entitled: Large Language Model's Accuracy - Impact of Negative Raising.

The thesis aimed at answering the following questions.

The examples were created based on the dataset designed by Nieuwland and Kuperberg (2009). The code has been adapted to work on the file attached to the paper, negation_items.xlsx

To answer the above question, I created two experiments which contained sentences created on a similar premise, although with varying nuances

The sentences used in experiment 1 are shorter. They contain affirmative and negative sentences. For each negative sentences, two versions are created, with negation cue raised and not.

The sentences used in experiment 2 are longer and more complex, containing more slots into which negation can be inserted, therefore varying the distance between the negation cue and its scope.
